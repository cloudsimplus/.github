# üìò‚ùì Documentation and Help

The project documentation originated from CloudSim was entirely updated and extended. 
You can see the JavaDoc for classes and their elements directly on your IDE.

The documentation is available online at [ReadTheDocs](http://cloudsimplus.rtfd.io), 
which includes a FAQ and guides.
CloudSim Plus has extended documentation of classes and interfaces and also includes extremely helpful
package documentation that can be viewed directly on your IDE or at the link provided above.
Such a package documentation gives a general overview of the classes used to build a cloud simulation. Also, check the [publications](#publications) section to access published CloudSim Plus papers.

A Google Group forum is available at <https://groups.google.com/group/cloudsimplus> and you can also use the [Discussions page here](https://github.com/cloudsimplus/cloudsimplus/discussions).

# üë®üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Consulting

If you are doing research on cloud computing simulation and facing challenging issues, I've started to offer my consulting services.

I can help you with different kinds of issues and provide specific features for your simulations, including resource allocation, task scheduling, VM placement and migration, metrics computation, process automation, debugging, results analysis, validation and more.

If you have a CloudSim project and want to migrate to CloudSim Plus to benefit from its extensive documentation, active development and support, exclusive features, great accuracy and performance, the consulting can be fit for you too.
